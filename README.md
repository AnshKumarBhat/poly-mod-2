## Introduction

This project focuses on creating a zkSNARK circuit that performs specific logical operations. The circuit will be written in the Circom programming language, and a verifier smart contract will be deployed on-chain to validate the proofs generated by this circuit. zkSNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) provide a way to prove knowledge of a solution without revealing the solution itself, ensuring privacy and security.

## Features

- **Logical Operations Circuit**: Implement logical gates using Circom.
- **zkSNARK Proof Generation**: Generate zero-knowledge proofs for the implemented logical operations.
- **On-Chain Verifier**: Deploy a verifier smart contract on a blockchain to verify the proofs.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed
- Circom installed
- SnarkJS installed
- Solidity development environment (e.g., Hardhat, Truffle)
- Access to a blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zkSNARK-logical-operations.git
    cd zkSNARK-logical-operations
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Install Circom and SnarkJS**

    Follow the installation instructions for [Circom](https://docs.circom.io/getting-started/installation/) and [SnarkJS](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs).

## Usage

1. **Compile the Circuit**

    ```bash
    circom circuits/logical_operations.circom --r1cs --wasm --sym --c
    ```

2. **Generate the Witness**

    ```bash
    node generate_witness.js logical_operations_js/logical_operations.wasm input.json witness.wtns
    ```

3. **Setup the zkSNARK**

    ```bash
    snarkjs groth16 setup logical_operations.r1cs pot12_final.ptau logical_operations_0000.zkey
    snarkjs zkey contribute logical_operations_0000.zkey logical_operations_final.zkey --name="First contribution"
    snarkjs zkey export verificationkey logical_operations_final.zkey verification_key.json
    ```

4. **Generate a Proof**

    ```bash
    snarkjs groth16 prove logical_operations_final.zkey witness.wtns proof.json public.json
    ```

5. **Verify the Proof**

    ```bash
    snarkjs groth16 verify verification_key.json public.json proof.json
    ```

## Project Structure

- **circuits/**: Contains the Circom circuit files.
- **contracts/**: Contains the Solidity verifier contract.
- **scripts/**: Contains scripts for compiling and deploying contracts.
- **test/**: Contains test scripts for the circuit and smart contracts.

## Testing

1. **Run Unit Tests**

    Use your preferred testing framework to run tests. For example, with Hardhat:

    ```bash
    npx hardhat test
    ```

## Deployment

1. **Compile and Deploy the Verifier Contract**

    Use your preferred development environment to compile and deploy the smart contract. For example, with Hardhat:

    ```bash
    npx hardhat compile
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network your-network
    ```

2. **Verify Proofs On-Chain**

    Interact with the deployed verifier contract to verify proofs on-chain.
